# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
**Keywords** - Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Python, NLTK, scikit-learn

### Quick Project Description -
  - Built and trained machine learning models to analyse and classify the binary sentiment of a movie review in the dataset of IMDB movie reviews containing 50,000 movie reviews.
  - Experimented with and tuned Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes and SVM models for the classification, achieving accuracy of 87.4% with Linear SVM model with frequency bag-of-words text representation.



### Project Repo Navigation
  - `Code` folder contains python code files to pre-process the raw text data and train the machine learning models
     - The set of python files `generate_dataset_*.py` clean and pre-processe the text data
     - `model_training_bagOfwords.py` trains several machine learning models using bag-of-words text representation
     - `model_training_freqency_bagOfwords.py` trains several machine learning models using  frequency bag-of-words text representation
  - `Dataset` folder contains the raw as well as the pre-processed dataset
  - At `Root` location
